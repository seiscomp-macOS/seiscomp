## Checkout the repositories with script clone_seiscomp-macos.sh

The SeisComP software collection is distributed among several repositories.
This repository only contains the build environment, the runtime framework
(seiscomp control script) and the documentation.

To checkout all repositories to build a complete SeisComP distribution for macOS the following
script can be used.

Copy/paste the following content to file: `clone_seiscomp-macos.sh`

```
#!/bin/bash

target_dir="seiscomp-macOS"
repo_path=https://github.com/seiscomp-macos/

WORKDIR=$(pwd)

echo "Cloning seiscomp base repository into $target_dir"
git clone $repo_path/seiscomp.git $target_dir

echo "Cloning base components"
cd $target_dir/src/base
git clone $repo_path/seedlink.git
git clone $repo_path/common.git
git clone $repo_path/main.git
git clone $repo_path/mainx.git
git clone $repo_path/extras.git

echo "Cloning external base components"
git clone $repo_path/contrib-gns.git
git clone $repo_path/contrib-ipgp.git
git clone $repo_path/contrib-sed.git

echo "Cloning SeisComP MeRT repo into ${target_dir}/src/base/extras/"
/bin/cd "${target_dir}/src/extras/" 
git clone $repo_path/scmert.git

echo "Done cloning seiscomp-macOS"

cd ../../
```

To keep track of the state of each subrepository, [mu-repo](http://fabioz.github.io/mu-repo/)
is a recommended way.


## Build

### Linux Prerequisites (not required for macOS compilation)

The following packages should be installed to compile SeisComP:

- g++
- git
- cmake + cmake-gui
- libboost
- libxml2-dev
- flex
- libfl-dev
- libssl-dev
- crypto-dev
- libbson-dev
- python-dev (optional)
- python-numpy (optional)
- libqt4-dev (optional)
- qtbase5-dev (optional)
- libmysqlclient-dev (optional)
- libpq-dev (optional)
- libsqlite3-dev (optional)
- ncurses-dev (optional)

The Python development libraries are required if Python wrappers should be
compiled which is the default configuration. The development files must
match the used Python interpreter of the system. If the system uses Python3
then Python3 development files must be present in exactly the same version
as the used Python3 interpreter. The same holds for Python2.

Python-numpy is required if Numpy support is enable which is also
the default configuration.

### macOS Prerequisites

This will compile SeisComP natively on macOS for both Mac INTEL or Mac Silicon architectures (M1, M2, M3).
Tested on macOS Ventura 13.x and Sonoma 14.x on Mac INTEL and Mac Silicon.

- Install Xcode Development Tools

First we need to install the Development tools (Command Line Tools).
Note that the full Xcode Development Tools from "Mac App Store" is *not* required.

Open your "Terminal.app" and install Xcode command line tools with command:

`xcode-select --install`

- Install Homebrew for macOS

Install Homebrew 'brew' command with the following one-liner:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

On INTEL Mac the default Homebrew directory location is in: `/usr/local/`
On Apple Silicon Mac the default Homebrew directory location is in: `/opt/homebrew/opt/`

Python 3.11 is recommended since Python 3.12 has compatibility issues with seedlink.

First install Python v3.11 with NumPy, which needs to be installed as a site-package with pip3.

```
brew install python@3.11
brew install numpy
pip3.11 install numpy
```

Continue installing macOS dependencies with:

```
brew install boost 
brew install cmake
brew install fftw 
brew install flex
brew install gfortran
brew install hdf5
brew install mysql #mariadb can also be installed as an alternative
brew install ncurses
brew install openssl
brew install qt5
brew install swig
```

Note: If you need a more specific version of Python with NumPy, e.g. Python 3.10:

`brew install python@3.10`
`pip3.10 install numpy`

After that check or update your PATH to include Homebrew paths:

The Homebrew shell path for INTEL Mac /usr/local/bin/ and /usr/local/sbin and /opt/homebrew/bin resp. /opt/homebrew/sbin/
should be in your PATH. Edit your `~/.bashrc` accordingly

`echo $PATH`

On INTEL Mac, your `~/.bashrc`should look like (note the `/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:` before `/bin/:/usr/bin`)

`PATH=/usr/local/bin/:/usr/local/sbin/:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11/bin:$PATH`

On Apple Silicon Mac, your `~/.bashrc`should look like (note the `/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:` before `/bin/:/usr/bin`)

`PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:$PATH`


### Clone the Github repositories  from https://github.com/seiscomp-macos/

Note that the script `clone_seiscomp-macos.sh` uses the repo from https://github.com/seiscomp-macos/ and not from https://github.com/seiscomp
Use the script  `clone_seiscomp-macos.sh` to git-clone all the repos.

Here's how to proceed:

1. Create directory seiscomp-macos inside your Downloads directory:

```
mkdir ~/Downloads/seiscomp-macos
cd ~/Downloads/seiscomp-macos
```
Move the script `clone_seiscomp-macos.sh` to `~/Downloads/seiscomp-macos`

Change script to executable - do this once:

`chmod u+x clone_seiscomp-macos.sh`

Now clone the seiscomp-macOS repos inside `~/Downloads/seiscomp-macos`
 `./clone_seiscomp-macos.sh`
 
After this you will see a the source-code directory named: `seiscomp` inside `~/Downloads/seiscomp-macos`

### Compile seiscomp on macOS 

After succesful git-cloning with the script `clone_seiscomp-macos.sh`, compile SeisComP on your Mac with command: `cmake`

Still inside `~/Downloads/seiscomp-macos` do the following:

```
mkdir build-seiscomp
cd build-seiscomp
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/seiscomp ../seiscomp
```

Note 1: if you need to use a specific Python version, e.g "Python 3.10" (don't forget to set your PATH accordingly):
`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/seiscomp ../seiscomp/ -DPython_VERSION_REQUIRED=3.10`

Compile SeisComP for macOS in the `build-seiscomp` directory:

`make -j4`

Install with command:

`make install`

If compilation was succesful it will install the binaries and libraries in ${HOME}/seiscomp (the MAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX).
Launch (test) e.g 'scmv' or 'scrttv' with command:

`/Users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/seiscomp/bin/`


Note 1: After compilation the seedlink plugins directory contains compiled libraries e.g. libreftek.a libutil.a etc and objects .o
You should clean up the "seedlink/plugins" directory to be sure to recompile the latest versions (not necessary but should help compilation errors).
Also if you copy your "seiscomp" directory to another platform (Apple Silicon) or INTEL the compiled libraries are still there, so better do a `make clean`.

Just go to `seiscomp/src/base/seedlink/plugins` and do a `make clean`

```
cd seiscomp/src/base/seedlink/plugins
make clean
```

### Configure MySQL on macOS for better performance

Copy default MYSQL configuration file to /etc/my.cnf with command:

`sudo cp $(brew --prefix mysql)/support-files/my-default.cnf /etc/my.cnf`

For better performance with the MySQL database, adjust the following parameters in /etc/my.cnf
If you have more than 8GB of RAM, increase `innodb_buffer_pool_size` (default is 128MB):
 
```
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 8G
innodb-buffer-pool-instances=16
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2
```

### macOS Troubleshooting

If you get the following error when compiling:

`"_Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND"`

Then you forgot to install NumPy with `pip3` (NumPy site-package).
To fix, do this:

```
#brew install numpy
#pip3 install numpy
```

The NumPy site-package will then be installed to:

`/usr/local/lib/python3.<VERSION_NUMBER>/site-packages`

### Configuration

The SeisComP build system provides several build options which can be
controlled with a cmake gui or from the commandline
passing `-D[OPTION]=ON|OFF` to cmake.

In addition to standard cmake options such as `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
the following global options are available:

|Option|Default|Description|
|------|-------|-----------|
|SC_GLOBAL_UNITTESTS|ON|Whether to build unittests or not. If enabled then use `ctest` in the build directory to run the unittests.|
|SC_GLOBAL_PYTHON_WRAPPER|ON|Build Python wrappers for the C++ libraries. You should not turn off this option unless you know exactly what you are doing.|
|SC_GLOBAL_PYTHON_WRAPPER_NUMPY|ON|Add Numpy support to Python wrappers. If enabled then all SeisComP arrays will provide a method `numpy()` which returns a Numpy array representation.|
|SC_ENABLE_CONTRIB|ON|Enable inclusion of external contributions into the build. This includes all directories in `src/extras`.|
|SC_GLOBAL_GUI|ON|Enables compilation of GUI components. This requires the Qt libraries to be installed. Either Qt4 or Qt5 are supported. The build will prefer Qt5 if found and will fallback to Qt4 if the Qt5 development libraries are not installed on the host system.|
|SC_GLOBAL_GUI_QT5|ON|If SC_GLOBAL_GUI is enabled then Qt5 support will be enabled if this option is active. Otherwise only Qt4 will be supported.|
|SC_DOC_GENERATE|OFF|Enable generation of documentation|
|SC_DOC_GENERATE_HTML|ON|Enable generation of HTML documentation|
|SC_DOC_GENERATE_MAN|ON|Enable generation of MAN pages|
|SC_DOC_GENERATE_PDF|OFF|Enable generation of PDF documentation|

### Compilation
